A Python program to convert entered USD currency and show the data in INR by converting those entered value as per current latest INR Exchange Rate.

I've used https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ to generate an exchange-rate API.

Modules which I've used in the following program are:

- import requests
- import calendar
- from datetime import datetime
- import os
